## Speed

Tests with 10 cores:

- from block 30500962 to 32926204 (2.425.242 blocks) took about 15
  minutes.
  - The out file had 11872 lines. ~620 transactions were not found on
    RPC provider.
  
- from block 27419649Â to 30500962 (3.081.313 blocks) took about 3
  minutes 41 seconds.
  - Most of the transactions were not found on RPC provider.
  - Rerunning this block range resulted in 5 times more transactions.
  
It could take about 2~3 hours to find all transactions assuming
they're known to the RPC provider.

## Issues

- `ethClient.Client.FilterLogs` do not return any logs for some old
blocks. Example: 18687544

  - The block hash do not match with the hash read from `ethclient`.

- RPC provider returns not found for some transactions.
